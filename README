# Instructions

## Dependencies

Ensure the `wasm-bindgen` is installed 

```sh
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
```

and that `rustup` is targeting `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Building

First build the project targeting `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

Then use `wasm-bindgen` to create the js bindings.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
wasm-bindgen --out-dir ./dist --target web ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/cat-plead-merge.wasm
```

## Release mode
```sh
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
wasm-bindgen --out-dir ./dist --target web ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cat-plead-merge.wasm
```
